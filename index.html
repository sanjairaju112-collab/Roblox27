      Hey, I just felt like writing this because I genuinely enjoy talking to you. Our late-night talks are honestly some of the best parts of my day, especially when everything else feels quiet and calm. I really like how we can talk about anime and just get lost in random characters and storylines like it’s real life.

      <br><br>

      Playing Roblox with you, especially the horror games, is still my favourite kind of chaos . I like how comfortable our conversations feel, like I don’t have to pretend or act different.

      <br><br>

      Talking to you feels easy and natural, which is rare. Even the small, quiet moments feel nice when it’s with you. I don’t know how to explain it properly, but I really like the vibe we have.

      <br><br>

      I’m grateful for all the fun little memories we already have. I hope we keep having more late nights, more anime talks, and more scary Roblox moments. I just wanted you to know I appreciate you a lot and I’m really glad you’re in my life.

      <br><br>

      And yeah… happy birthday 🤍 I hope your day is full of smiles, fun, and everything you love.
